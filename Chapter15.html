<!-- Q1
Write a page that displays a balloon (using the balloon emoji, 🎈). When you press the up arrow, it should inflate (grow) 10 percent. When you press the down arrow, it should deflate (shrink) 10 percent.
You can control the size of text (emoji are text) by setting the font-size CSS property (style.fontSize) on its parent element. Remember to include a unit in the value—for example, pixels (10px).
The key names of the arrow keys are "ArrowUp" and "ArrowDown". Make sure the keys change only the balloon, without scrolling the page.
Once you have that working, add a feature where if you blow up the balloon past a certain size, it “explodes”. In this case, exploding means that it is replaced with an 💥 emoji, and the event handler is removed (so that you can’t inflate or deflate the explosion). -->

  let para = document.querySelector("p");
  let size;
  function setSize(newSize) {
    size = newSize;

  }

  setSize(20);

  function arrowHandler(event) {
    if (event.key == "ArrowUp") {
      if (size > 100) {
        para.textContent = "💥";
        document.body.removeEventListener("keydown", arrowHandler);
      } else {
        setSize(size * 1.5);
        event.preventDefault();
      }
    } 
    else if (event.key == "ArrowDown") {
      if(size > 10){
        setSize(size * 0.75);
        event.preventDefault();
      }
    }
  }

<!-- Q2
In JavaScript’s early days, which was the high time of gaudy home pages with lots of animated images, people came up with some truly inspiring ways to use the language. One of these was the mouse trail—a series of elements that would follow the mouse pointer as you moved it across the page.
In this exercise, I want you to implement a mouse trail. Use absolutely positioned <div> elements with a fixed size and background color (refer to the code in the “Mouse Clicks” section for an example). Create a bunch of these elements and, when the mouse moves, display them in the wake of the mouse pointer.
There are various possible approaches here. You can make your trail as simple or as complex as you want. A simple solution to start with is to keep a fixed number of trail elements and cycle through them, moving the next one to the mouse’s current position every time a "mousemove" event occurs. -->
<!doctype html>

<style>
  .trail { /* className for the trail elements */
    position: absolute;
    height: 6px; 
    width: 6px;
    border-radius: 3px;
    background: teal;
  }
  body {
    height: 300px;
  }
</style>

<body>
<script>
  let dots = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    let root = document.createElement("div");
    root.className = "trail";
    document.body.appendChild(root);
    dots.push(root);
  }

  let cnt = 0;
  window.addEventListener("mousemove", event => {
    let n = dots.length;
    let dot = dots[cnt];
    dot.style.left = (event.pageX - 3) + "px";
    dot.style.top = (event.pageY - 3) + "px";
    cnt = (cnt + 1) % n;
  });
</script>
</body>

<!-- Q3
Tabbed panels are common in user interfaces. They allow you to select an interface panel by choosing from a number of tabs “sticking out” above an element.
Implement a simple tabbed interface. Write a function, asTabs, that takes a DOM node and creates a tabbed interface showing the child elements of that node. It should insert a list of <button> elements at the top of the node, one for each child element, containing text retrieved from the data-tabname attribute of the child. All but one of the original children should be hidden (given a display style of none). The currently visible node can be selected by clicking the buttons.
When that works, extend it to style the button for the currently selected tab differently so that it is obvious which tab is selected. -->
<!doctype html>

<tab-panel>
  <div data-tabname="one">Tab one</div>
  <div data-tabname="two">Tab two</div>
  <div data-tabname="three">Tab three</div>
</tab-panel>
<script>
  function asTabs(node) {
    let tabs = Array.from(node.children).map(node => {
      let button = document.createElement("button");
      button.textContent = node.getAttribute("data-tabname");
      let tab = {node, button};
      button.addEventListener("click", () => selectTab(tab));
      return tab;
    });

    let tabList = document.createElement("div");
    for (let {button} of tabs) tabList.appendChild(button);
    node.insertBefore(tabList, node.firstChild);

    function selectTab(currTab) {
      for (let tab of tabs) {
        let flag = tab == currTab;
        tab.node.style.display = flag ? "" : "none";
        tab.button.style.color = flag ? "red" : "";
      }
    }
    selectTab(tabs[0]);
  }

  asTabs(document.querySelector("tab-panel"));
