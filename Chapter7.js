//Q3
// Write a new class PGroup, similar to the Group class from Chapter 6, which stores a set of values. Like Group, it has add, delete, and has methods. Its add method, however, returns a new PGroup instance with the given member added and leaves the old one unchanged. Similarly, delete creates a new instance without a given member.
// The class should work for values of any type, not just strings. It does not have to be eï¬€icient when used with large numbers of values.
